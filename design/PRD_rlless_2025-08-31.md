# Product Requirements Document: rlless

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-08-31  
**Status:** Draft  

## Executive Summary

rlless is a high-performance terminal-based log viewer designed to handle extremely large log files (40GB+) with SIMD-optimized search capabilities. Built with Rust 2024, it leverages ripgrep's powerful search engine and ratatui for an intuitive terminal interface, providing memory-efficient streaming and fast bidirectional search functionality similar to the Unix `less` command but optimized for massive log files.

## Problem Statement

Current log viewing tools struggle with extremely large log files (40GB+), often requiring:
- Complete file loading into memory, causing system resource exhaustion
- Slow search operations that don't leverage modern CPU SIMD capabilities  
- Poor performance with compressed log formats
- Limited backward search capabilities through large datasets
- Inefficient memory usage patterns for enterprise-scale log analysis

DevOps engineers and developers need a tool that can instantly navigate and search through massive log files without the memory overhead and performance bottlenecks of existing solutions.

## Goals & Objectives

2. **Memory efficiency** - Process large files using minimal RAM through streaming/chunked reading
3. **SIMD-powered search** - Leverage ripgrep's advanced search optimizations for instant regex matching
4. **Familiar interface** - Provide less-like navigation that developers already know
5. **Compression support** - Native handling of gzip, bzip2, xz, and other compressed formats

### Success Metrics:
- Open 40GB files in under 2 seconds
- Search through 40GB files with results appearing in under 500ms
- Memory usage stays under 100MB regardless of file size
